    <h1>Get Insights For a Single Location in Apple Business Connect</h1>
    <p>With Insights for locations, intuitive visualizations and downloadable reports help you gain a deeper understanding of how people find your brand's location, and what they do once they find it. Insights data includes searches and views associated with your location.</p>
    <h2>Insights availability</h2>
    <p>After verification, Insights data is available in both UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and the location's local time zone. Insights data can be aggregated by day, week (Sunday to Saturday), and month intervals.</p>
    <p>Note: Insights data is only collected from Apple Maps on iOS and iPadOS. Usage metrics below a reporting threshold are represented as zero.</p>
    <h2>See how customers find the location</h2>
    <p>The Search section provides you with modules to see how many times customers find you, and how they find you.</p>
